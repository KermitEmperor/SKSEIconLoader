# SKSE Icon and Title Swapper
<sub>also known as SKSE Icon Loader</sub>

An C++ SKSE plugin for Skyrim!

---
# What does it do?

It can basically swap the Taskbar/Window Icon and Title at runtime.
Easily configurable with the provided .ini file.

After running Skyrim, once at the Main Menu, press the `~` key to open the game console.
If the icon and/or app title didn't fail there should be a happy message there!

# CommonLibSSE NG

Because this uses [CommonLibSSE NG](https://github.com/CharmedBaryon/CommonLibSSE-NG), it supports Skyrim SE, AE, GOG, and VR. (theoretically)

# Requirements

- Windows (7?) 10/11, uses windows.h so i suspect it doesn't work on Linux/Mac, sorry penguin :(
- [SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379)
- [Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)

## Configuration (As user)

there should be an .ini file beside the DLL.

## Opening the project and Project setup

should be the same as [SKSE "Hello World!" Template](https://github.com/SkyrimScripting/SKSE_Template_HelloWorld) since this plugin has been based on that
